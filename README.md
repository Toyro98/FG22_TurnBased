# TurnBasedGame
## What's this?
If you happen to randomly find this, this is a game made in 5 weeks time while learning C# and Unity where we had to implement a few things. We had to create a turned based local multiplayer game based on [3D Worms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_3D). This project was made for a school project. If you'd like to open this project, it's using Unity 2021.3.9f1.

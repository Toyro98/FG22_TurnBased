# TurnBasedGame
## What's this?
If you happen to randomly find this, this is a game made in 5 weeks time while learning C# and Unity where we had to implement a few things.   
We had to create a game based on [3D Worms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_3D). This project was made for educational purpose. If you'd like to open this project, this project is using Unity 2021.3.9f1.
